# Past-Projects

This is an upload of the projects I started in high school.
* Machi Koro - While uncompleted, it is my best work yet. The main(String[]) function is in MachiKoro/src/thePackage/MachiKoroGame.java
* Shooter Game - Simple implementation of my personal 3D graphics engine (creatively titled "camera"). A compiled form of this project is in the main directory.
* Tissue Project - Homemade gui to illustrate epithelial and connective tissue. A compiled form of this project is in the main directory.
* Minesweeper - I wanted to see if I could recreate it.
